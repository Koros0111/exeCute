USING A VIRTUAL DESKTOP
       If a Windows application doesn't show properly, you can  try  launching
       it on a virtual desktop.

       For  that,  in  the  application  directory, create a file named 'desk‚Äê
       top.conf'.

       If you want the desktop to have a particular resolution, type it inside
       that file.

AUTOMOUNTING MS-DOS DISK IMAGES
       -  exeCute  will  automount  any disk images under the launched program
       folder, on drive 'D'.

       - You can change among multiple disk images with: Control + F4.

       - Compatible disk images are '.iso', '.cue' and '.gog'.

       - If there is no disk  image,  the  launched  program  folder  will  be
       mounted also on drive 'D'.
