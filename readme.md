VIRTUAL DESKTOP
       If a Windows application doesn't show properly, you can  try  launching
       it on a virtual desktop.

       For  that,  in  the  application  directory, create a file named 'desk‐
       top.conf'.

       If you want the desktop to have a particular resolution, type it inside
       that file.
